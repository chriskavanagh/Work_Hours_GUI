# Work_Hours_GUI                

A small project (test_gui2.py) to practice TKinter and SQLAlchemy. It could be used by an Employer to store employee information and
keep track of all employees. . .

I'm going to add another .db to keep track of individual work hours of each employee and their total pay.
